  "milestone": "Phase 3: L3 Memory, Agent Interface & Final Nexus Loop - COMPLETED",
  "completed_tasks": [
    "Project initialization with Node.js 22 + TypeScript (ESM)",
    "Implement EventBus with EventEmitter2 (Wildcard support)",
    "Implement JSONL Event Sourcing (events.jsonl)",
    "Successful execution of 'Test Zero' loop (ping/pong)",
    "Design and implement Dynamic DAG schema and Orchestrator",
    "Implement 3-Tier Memory Skeleton (L1: In-memory, L2: Local Scratchpad)",
    "Successful execution of 2-step DAG orchestration via EventBus",
    "Implemented L3 Memory Tier (VectorStore) with JSON-based semantic search",
    "Integrated L3 into MemoryManager.ts with metadata support",
    "Created standardized AgentInterface for registration and status reporting",
    "Implemented Error Handling & Retry Logic (Circuit Breaker) in DAGOrchestrator",
    "Created and passed 'Nexus Loop' Final Demo (src/nexus_final.ts) at 100%",
    "Final Clean & Polish: Full TypeScript typing and README documentation"

    "summary": "Nexus-Edge Orchestrator is fully functional. The framework successfully demonstrates an end-to-end agentic workflow: Research -> Summarization -> Long-term Semantic Storage. Key features include event sourcing for observability, a 3-tier memory model, and a resilient DAG orchestrator.",
    "code_deltas": "Added src/L3VectorStore.ts, src/AgentInterface.ts, and src/nexus_final.ts. Refined MemoryManager.ts, DAGOrchestrator.ts, and types.ts. Updated package.json and README.md.",
    "verification": "The 'Nexus Loop' demo confirms all milestones: Task A (Research) saves to L2; Task B (Summarize) stores in L1; Task C (Save to L3) commits to the Vector Store. Semantic retrieval from L3 was verified at 100% match.",
    "future_enhancements": [
      "Plugin real LLM-based embedding models (e.g., Transformers.js) for true semantic search.",
      "Expand AgentInterface to support capability-based task routing.",
      "Add a visual DAG dashboard by exposing the EventBus via WebSockets."
